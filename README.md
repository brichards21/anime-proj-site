# Analyzing Anime Scores Using the Power of Data

## Introduction 
Anime, a term derived from the Japanese abbreviation of “animation,” has become a significant part of global popular culture in recent decades. Its relevance in today’s culture can be attributed to several factors, including its unique art style, diverse storytelling techniques, and the ability to explore complex themes.

In recent years, the popularity of anime has skyrocketed, thanks to digital platforms and streaming services like Crunchyroll and HIDIVE making it easily accessible to a global audience. Anime conventions and events draw massive crowds, showcasing the passion and enthusiasm of fans. The influence of anime has permeated various aspects of popular culture, including fashion, music, video games, and even Hollywood adaptations.

MyAnimeList.net (MAL) is an online platform dedicated to providing a comprehensive database and community-driven hub for anime and manga enthusiasts. Serving as a centralized resource, the website allows users to create personal profiles and maintain detailed lists of anime series, films, and manga they have consumed. The site also facilitates user engagement through its rating and review system, enabling community members to express their opinions on individual titles.

## Data and Research Questions
We downloaded and cleaned three datasets housed on Kaggle scraped between February 26th and March 20th, 2020 containing information about 17,562 anime, and the preferences and ratings from 325,772 different users.

Using this data, we aimed to answer the following questions:

**1) What features are most important to predicting the score of an anime?**

**2) Do the scores of these anime differ based on all users vs. users that have that anime marked as completed in MAL?**

**3) Is there an optimal number of episodes an anime should be in order to score well on MyAnimeList?**

**4) Can the synopsis of an anime be a good indicator of anime ranking?**

This analysis answered these questions using a series of statistical methodologies like linear regression and prediction modeling, paired t-tests, and text analysis procedures.
